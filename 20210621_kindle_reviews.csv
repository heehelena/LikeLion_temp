Worldwidehavok,4,"April 25, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I love books. Paper books. But, when traveling, they are not ideal. Aside from being heavy, they take up valuable luggage space. So, I broke down and bought my first Kindle. So far, I love it  I've read about 15 books on it in the first month ive used it.  Amazon gives you $5 to the Kindle store so I used that and all the other books I've gotten using my Libby pr Overdrive app.One of the main reasons I bought the Kindle I did is because I wanted library access. The only complaint is that I have to sign in every time to load a book to the Kindle. I use a VPN, so I get a text from Amazon to verify my log in. This is a bit obnoxious, but only take ls a few seconds.I read every night and the self-adjusting light is excellent. I also bought a case and I highly recommend getting one when you order your Kindle.The issues I've run into are:1.  The touch screen isn't as sensitive as a phone. So, you may have to tap a few times to get where you want to go.2.  Since the first charge, my Kindle will only get to 98% and no higher. I wait to charge until I'm less than 30%, usually much lower. Not sure if this is a common issue.3.  Wifi with a password at a hotel did not work. The Kindle would not open the password/sign on page. This was a hassle for a week as I had to tether to my phone hot spot every time I wanted to download or return a book.Overall, I am super happy with my first Kindle. I still love a paper book, but this is so much easier to travel with and swap books based on mood."
JackandCyn1,2,"August 29, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"Warning: this will be a long review.  First, I've owned Kindle e-readers since the Kindle keyboard.  I love to read.  I love to re-read my books - isn't that why we buy a device to haul all of our books around?  No more second suitcase for vacations, or bookbags to bring with my purse?  When my Kindle Voyage started to die, I started researching the new Kindles.  The biggest draw to the Oasis for me was the larger storage capapbilities.  No more having ""too many books"" for my Kindle to hold.  The second draw was the battery life- it was one of my favorite things about the Voyage.  My battery would last a week with it (yes, I read a LOT - sometimes my Kindle is on upwards of 15 hours a day).  So, imagine my disappointment when my new Oasis battery lasted 36 hours.  Ok,  I get it - I was downloading books and collections.  It takes a lot of battery.  But I am not so new to Kindle that I didn't already have the screen turned down and airplane mode on when not downloading.  It didn't matter - 36 hours.  After doing 2 factory resets with the aid of Kindle support (come on, I just want to read my books, not continuously reset my device and have to re-download everything), they finally decided the best thing to do was to send me a new one.  Maybe my first was a fluke..  No.  36 hours.  Amazon offered to replace it again.  I said no - if the battery is supposed to last 3 weeks (what I was told by the rep) and I read a lot, it should still be lasting a week!  So with the help of Jessica H (this girl is a gem - you guys need to give her a raise!), the downloaded my ""logs"" to the tech team.  When the tech team couldn't figure anything out, they had me manually download the logs and email them in.  Then I did a factory reset.  Then they had me let my Oasis completely deplete, wait for 2 minutes before plugging it in and recharging it, and then logging the battery constantly for the next 24+ hours.  Oh - but in the meantime the techs came back with the brilliant reasoning that the reason my battery wasn't lasting was that I had TOO MANY books downloaded to my device!  WTH?!  I had just gotten it and done factory restarts on it - there are less than 200 books on there!  And wait - wasn't that the whole point to having 32 GB of memory - so I COULD have my books on my device????  At the end of the call back, the only option they had for me was to once again replace a $260 device that had already failed TWICE.  Why?  Because my original purchase was 70 days ago, so I was beyond the return period.  Luckily Jessica H (seriously - wonderful, helpful, and always called when she said she would) spent THREE HOURS to get an exception to allow the return.  I will go out of Amazon and buy a replacement battery for my Voyage.  If I replace my Voyage again, it will be with a basic $99 Kindle - because I know what to expect from that - and not have high hopes that I had with the Oasis."
Dave_5k,3,"October 21, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"Outstanding experience other than battery life, which is at best 1/3 of my paperwhite for actual usable reading time.  Love having the page turn buttons which was primary reason for getting the oasis. Slightly uncomfortable to hold 1-handed, but able to adjust & like the ability to switch hands & have screen auto-rotate.However, for trips, looks like I'll stick with the old Paperwhite. Paperwhite I can take on trip for a week, read heavily the entire trip, and come back with 50% power.  Oasis is dead after 3 days of heavy reading. Using both with wireless off, and at very low brightness.  On plus side Oasis does charge its itty bitty battery much faster, so if you don't mind being tethered to keeping an extra charger along, it is basically like another phone to charge every other day or so of heavy use."
CWM,3,"June 17, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"The functionality usability readability etc are all excellent. This is my 4th kindle and I jumped once I saw another model with physical buttons to touch to turn pages. In my opinion going away from that option is the biggest downfall in kindle design after they removed it post “keyboard” editions.The battery life however is abysmal. Even legacy models were, as advertised, good for weeks between charges, and that was with reading on it on a more than average basis. This Oasis with warm light however is dead inside three days with minimal use. For example, I charged it two days ago so I can read before bed. I read that night, again when I woke up in the middle of the night for a bit, same last night, and it has already died on me on the third night. I don’t use a very high backlight so it shouldn’t be draining this fast.The older paper white I had did this and a call to customer service and an update solved the battery drain but amazon has gotten so global it no longer values customer service. If I can get a person on the phone to try to troubleshoot this oasis they barely speak English and if they do are rude and dismissive and I have been disconnected each time before they tried to fix the problem.Fix what you have amazon, before trying to add more services only one or two areas have access to, or using us to underwrite more terrible amazon tv shows. You are close to losing a customer."
Zippy1643,4,"October 10, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"Easy to set up.  Like the Bluetooth connectivity.  Easy to download and unload books using Kindle Unlimited.  The device is comfortable to hold and is lightweight.  I do like the setting capability for warm/bright white.  You will need the Wifi connection to get definitions of word, likewise to download books.  Have not used audible books as yet.  Compared to white light Kindle battery life may be somewhat shorter but it is okay for me.The browser is actually useless.  Too sensitive to enlarge screen and to interact with internet source.  Like when connecting at free wi-fi sites.  Screen display for browser is very poor.  (It is not the same as the reading screen for books downloaded).  Hopefully Amazon will have a software update."
David Rosenberg,5,"August 26, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"I have had a Kindle Paperwhite for quite a few years.  Doing more reading in the dark, I thought it time to try spending the money on the current generation Oasis (for more uniform illumination and the warm light feature).  After owning it, I do also find I like the lighter weight and the balance of having more mass around the edge with the buttons.  My first ever e-reader was a non-touch Kobo...in which you held it at the bottom and scrolled through with a D-pad.  Having two buttons on the side seems more natural as a page turn.After setting up my Oasis, I started seeing two bright spots.  I contacted Amazon and there were not many questions until they issued me a replacement.  It was sent immediately, and it's holding up (I haven't had this level of service with Amazon before).There are a few aspects about the reader that people may be critical of.  The first is that it's meant for the Amazon echo-system.  For the Kindle books that you've bought/acquired....those are easy to sync to your new device (and keep in their collections).  I've used Caliber for converting other downloaded eBooks to Kindle format.  I've found I've had to manually upload them and then add them to collections once in the Kindle (trying to copy from ""documents"" from the old Kindle to new didn't work so well).The second aspect is battery life.  I like having the Kindle illuminated, which I know draws more power.  It does seem as though battery life is less than my old Paperwhite, but I don't have issues with charging more frequently.  I also haven't thrown out my old USB cables and power adapters, so I don't have as much grievance with this reader having micro-USB instead of USB C.The third is the interface for disabling the screen if all you want to use is the buttons (which I like, so that I can clean the screen of any flecks and not accidentally brush it and then pages are advanced).  You have to be in a book before going to the menu, tapping the ... button, then you have the option for turning off the screen.  That in itself isn't too hard....but then it stays like that until you put the Kindle to sleep.  Then, once you wake it up again, the touchscreen is now active.  I'd prefer a way to set touchscreen as being inactive permanently....and then perhaps over-riding by an action with the buttons (like, for example, pressing either button for a set period of time)."
Dave C,3,"January 14, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"Buttons, I have been missing them, but the Oasis really is so far from perfect. I like to read with one hand, so buttons on the side, or back would be so much better. My Voyager was the right size to fit in a back pocket, this one is too wide for that. It's a good size for reading, and the screen is excellent. I really like the orange backlight for reading in a dark room.Make a kindle that is a little thicker than the oasis, same size screen, all plastic (less slippery than the Oasis), with physical buttons on the sides (both sides!) or back, orange backlight, and you'll have the perfect ebook reader.  Buttons on just one side, and the back would be acceptable if the screen rotates like the Oasis."
J. Reyes,5,"October 20, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Love it. With as fast as I swap out tech my kindle PW3 was the only thing I kept and used constantly. This year I finally decided to upgrade my beloved kindle to the new oasis 3.I couldn’t be happier. The new oasis has a fantastic screen. Battery life has been excellent. I love the physical buttons. And the build quality is outstanding.It is my hope it holds up as well as my previous kindle PW3 and will serve me many years. I paired it with the leather case. Not the premium version just the standard and the fit and finish are amazing in hand. So far so good.I highly recommend this kindle. Especially if your coming from a much older model. It may not be much of a upgrade for those who have last years model but for me it was a huge leap forward.
Heather O,4,"June 22, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"I am a long time kindle user and have had several. My most recent is the 1st Oasis and I loved it. My main problem with it was with the charging cover. I didn’t like that it came off so easily and over time, it stopped switching from the cover to the main battery automatically so I had to remove it to keep reading. I liked that it made the oasis flat so I kept it on until I had to recharge.After reading about this new version having an amber light I decided to upgrade. Plus it’s waterproof and I read in the tub a lot. The screen is evenly lit, the warmer light is wonderful, the interface is fast, and its overall great.That being said, the size difference was a lot more noticeable than I expected. It’s very large. At least as big as my old paper white which I always felt was bulky. It seems unwieldy after using the Oasis 1 for the last few years. One of the things I loved about the oasis was the portable size that fit so well in my hand, purse, or jacket pocket. I will keep this and use it, but the second they come out with one similar in size to the original, with the bells and whistles this has, and with a seamless ergonomic case, I’m trading this bad boy in."
James R. Van der Veen,5,"February 22, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"As an old fart, an instruction and operations manual would be great. Also a trouble shooting guide would be wonderful. I had to return my first unit after spending 50 minutes with a very nice Amazon helper. She and I both agreed I needed a new one. Well, I hot the new one and had a lot of similar issues, but the issue is knowing how to use it. Now, after about 40 books, I've almost figured out how to use the damn thing. But I  read for 3 to 5 hours a night as part of my sleeping routine. I don't sleep well. I also use blue light glasses to cut the blue light hitting my eyes. My cell phone has this as an additional feature. Well, I've read a lot of books, all action/adventure, and I'm not sleeping any worse, but not a lot better. I think my problem is subject matter. I live in south Florida, have spent years in the Bahamas and Keys, and this is the backdrop to all of my books. So, I will now start searching of non-action/adventure style books. Might end up reading the Bible, but it's action/adventure most of the time on an even larger format.  So who knows??"

AO,5,"March 24, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"This was my first Kindle purchase. Didn’t know what to expect. I’d used the app before but an actual Kindle doesn’t really compare. Took me a while to choose the right one and although the price for the Oasis is significantly higher, the two features that sold me were the page turn buttons (although I switched their functions) and the warm light. I was unaware of the e-ink technology but find it pleasing. It did take me a minute to get used to the flashing sometimes but now I understand it’s not a defect but rather a feature of the technology. I also stupidly thought the image on the screen when I opened the box was a sticker and spent a few seconds trying to peel it off. Learned that the technology doesn’t require any battery power to keep an image on the screen once the e-ink has drawn it. Nifty. I had resisted going electronic with books for years but what finally did it for me was a chunk of hair that was hidden and mashed in between some pages of a book I ordered off Amazon. I promptly threw the book away, continued reading it on the app on my iPad and began looking at Kindles. I’m glad I did. I love the Oasis. Special mention for the battery life. It lasts for weeks, especially if you turn on airplane mode when you don’t need the extra features."

I called to set up the UPS return, the agent in South Africa, said I would receive only only 80% return b/c of restocking fee, or because under warranty, would exchange for a REFURBISHED ONE.  Interesting that they already have ones  they had to refurbish...I was so excited:  my first e-reader! Foolish me, I did not read complaints  b/c I pre-ordered  Shame on Bezos.

astateprincess,5,"August 21, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I love reading, and I’ve missed having buttons since I upgraded from a kindle keyboard to a paper white 7 years ago.  I’m ambidextrous so it’s great that you can hold in either hand.  I’m in to alternative medicine, and I think blue light causes my migraines.  I wear blue light blocking glasses at work and have my iPhone set to change to warm light at 6 pm.  As I go to bed reading every night, I believe the warm light has decreased my migraines and helped me sleep better.  I’m disappointed that I had to charge it after 2 weeks, but hoping it was just new use and that it will last longer on this charge.  I also reversed the page turn buttons, I thought it was weird to have to use the top button to turn forward.  If this had not been an option, I probably would have returned the kindle oasis and gotten a new paper white."
LN,3,"January 4, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"ANOTHER UPDATE:I contacted customer service again this time through chat after rechecking the device warranty page.  It does in fact come with a 1 year warranty and Amazon is sending a free replacement.  I still don't like the fact that the screen cracked but at least Amazon addressed the issue.UPDATE:I've had the kindle since Nov 2019.  I was happy with it.  One of the selling points of an ereader is the ability to read outdoors and this model in particular is waterproof.  The first time I used the e-reader for a few hours in the hot sun it got so hot I could no longer use it.  I placed it in my tote that only had a towel in it.  When I went to read it later, the screen was cracked.  It wasn't dropped, it wasn't banged up.  Just cracked.  As mentioned below I have many other Kindles and have used them for years.  Carried in backpacks, suitcases etc.  Never a problem.  I've read in more recent reviews that this model has a problem with screen cracking.  I would agree.  When I contacted customer service they said since I was outside of the 3 month warranty (not a year?) there was nothing they could do except offer me 15% off a new one.  No options for repair at all.DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE OASIS until a new version with a better screen is available.Finally the e-reader I've been looking for.  I own a non-Kindle brand, a Kindle Touch and an older model Kindle Paperwhite.  This has my favorite features of each of those plus more.  I love the option of buttons for page turning and touch mode, I no longer have to worry about gloves or lotions getting in the way.  I can flip easily from between reading left and right sided reading, making drinking coffee and reading easy.  The waterproofing means poolside reading isn't a worry.  Plus my new favorite feature, amber reading at bedtime.  All this plus the ease of using Amazon's Kindle features and benefits.  I'm happy with battery life, as with my other Kindles I keep it in airplane mode unless downloading books."
L.A. Blu,4,"January 2, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"The Oasis is very nice, but I prefer the Kindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" E Ink Display model. AMAZON, will you EVER bring this model back? Please?(My Kindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" E Ink Display was 9+ years old - I dropped it [from only 1-1/2-feet high] on a ceramic tile floor and the screen broke. The screen is now permanently 1/3 screen saver whether on/off.  It fit in  my purse and/or pocket perfectly and had buttons for left or right handed page turning. It was simple and PERFECT and more like a REAL book)The Oasis is just too big and I do not like the lighting or the touch screen - at all. The touch screen to far too sensitive - constantly losing/searching for my page. The blanket or the dog's whiskers barely touch the edge of the screen and the pages are turning.  The auto page rotation drives me nuts. The unit feels 'slippery' - there's no texture to it at all - it's hard to hold onto.The leather case (which is 1/2 plastic) doesn't help much - it's flimsy and cheap - definitely not worth $50.00The Kindle Fire was a total waste of money.There's a lot of Bells & Whistles on the Oasis, which is great if you like Bells & Whistles (why I give it 4-stars), but I prefer to keep it simple with a unit like the Kindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" E Ink Display model - it was closer to reading a REAL book."
dontpanic42,4,"January 11, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I really love the concept of this kindle.  I love the warm light and button features which maybe justifies the cost, initially.  The warm light it especially a boon if you share a bed with someone who falls asleep before you.  The light it very customizable so as not to bother your eyes or people near you.  The ergonomic design and buttons are another benefit of the Oasis.  I purchased a case because the metal of the kindle is cold.  I do wish the backing was the same as traditional Kindle, the soft rubber stuff, but it’s a personal preference.The Oasis is almost completely wonderful.  But, for the money, the battery life is a major reading buzz kill.  My old Kindle 4 had weeks of battery life.  Weeks!  This has a few days at best.  Don’t expect long battery life if you’re a voracious reader.  Expect to plan charging frequently.  You can experiment with light settings and WiFi settings to see if it helps your battery life but I’ve not found significant differences."
Kindle Customer,5,"March 25, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"This my third e-reader. The previous one was a 7th-gen Kindle. That was good, but the screen was too small, the backlighting inadequate, the pages too slow to turn, and I didn’t like swiping. All these features are fixed in the Oasis. The buttons turn pages instantly, the screen lighting is perfect, and the screen is the minimum I like for extended reading. It’s lightweight. It’s great!And it has the standard Kindle long-storage battery and high resolution.I look forward to a further version that is closer in size to a paperback book, but will happily use this until then."
Kaniki,3,"June 4, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I like the new kindle oasis because of the backlighting (means I can read while my husband sleeps).  However, the battery life is just over two days if you delete the wi-fi info.  If you have the wi-fi data input, you cannot turn it off and on so then the battery lasts only about a day and a half.  Using airplane mode does not extend the battery much.  Really disappointing since I read for about two to six hours a day.  So that means at the most, the battery lasts 12 hours without recharging.  Again, really disappointed with the battery.  My first kindle battery lasted a month (without wi-fi on)."
Ronald L. Babb,4,"December 26, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I replaced my Voyage with the new Oasis.  The ability to choose a warm background for the text is a game changer.  I loved my Voyage, it has traveled the world with me, but really like my Oasis.  I have seen several write of very short battery life and at first I thought I was seeing that also.  Then I realized it was downloading my library, as I had instructed, in the background.  Once that was done it seems to have battery life equivalent to what I saw with my Voyage.  So far I have few complaints.  My next Kindle ereader  i think I will order ad free.Amazon has gotten more aggressive with their advertising and I am a bit put off by it.After using the Oasis for a few months I decided to amend my review.  It is too big.  It won’t find in jacket pockets, Jean pockets or anything I normally wear.  I cannot take it with me as I have always done with my Voyage.  I still carry my Voyage, the Oasis stays home.  It is more like a hard back book, not really good for travel. Perhaps a nice Paperwhite would be a better choice.  The Oasis stays on the nightstand."
Beauty Star,5,"October 20, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"This is an outstanding kindle. The screen is easy on the eyes. I purchased the gold color for myself and the graphite as a gift. I love that you have the option of turning the pages with the up (forward) or down ((backward) buttons. You also have the choice of touching the bottom of screen on left or right side of screen for turning pages forward or backwards. To get to menus just swipe.across top of screen. I haven’t owned device long enough to comment on battery life. The only complaint I have is the ergonomic grip. I’m not a fan of the ergonomic grip but I found the remedy for this by purchasing a case that conceals the bulky grip by placing Kindle inside the plastic holder in back of cover that has a smooth flat back. I purchased 32 GB without ads and with WiFi. I didn’t see any advantage in spending extra $50 for free cellular when all you get is free Wikipedia and the Amazon store data on the cellular. With a cell phone with unlimited data, I didn’t see the benefit in spending the extra money."
Edson W. Kempe,4,"August 23, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"I have had many versions of the Kindle, and this is my second Oasis. They have been more than satisfactory, as is this one, but it does have a couple of quirks. If you read more than two hours a day, even if you are careful and only use the internet as briefly as possible and do not exceed the mid lightness position, a week to ten days is the max on a charge; certainly adequate but not ""weeks."" Due to the variation in thickness, if the device is placed on a flat surface to read, best change pages by tapping the screen, not pressing the buttons. Using the buttons will rock the device and provide an uncertain result. If holding it in the hands to read do not hold it by or have a finger on the black area to the left of the reading area. Otherwise a small inadvertent squeeze on the black area on the right will send you to what seems to be a random location earlier in the copy or article you are reading. And while not a drawback, I have been unable to figure out the purpose of ""warming"" the screen. My lack of imagination, no doubt."
M. lewis,5,"March 29, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"I’d hesitated to buy this because it’s expensive. I loved my Paperwhite and Fire, and thought, “How much better could the Oasis be, really”?It is THAT much better! Virtually perfect, as far as I can see!"
Jules T.,5,"January 6, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"I am thrilled with this Oasis! I thought long and hard before buying this and read a million reviews before deciding to go for it, many of which made me nervous. So many people have said that it's overpriced for what it is or that it feels flimsy, but in my opinion, it is well worth what I paid for it. For those that complain about the micro-usb for recharging instead of the usb-c connector, who cares? lol As long as it charges, I don't care what kind of cable it needs. I have congenital cataracts and I'm prone to migraines, both of which make me sensitive to cool bright white light, so the warm light option with the ability to dim the light as needed on the new Oasis was an absolute must. I love to read and relax in the tub so the waterproof aspect of this Kindle was very important. I bought the blue water-safe cover that Amazon makes for it as well. It's such a relief to no longer fear dropping my device in the water accidentally, although I have no plans to actually test whether it actually is waterproof, lol.  Holding it is a dream - it's not heavy at all but is a perfect weight (and it does not feel flimsy!), and the way the back is shaped lets it rest easily in one hand. The page forward and page back buttons are awesome -  I always hated having to swipe pages to turn them on other devices. I can switch hands easily as the screen rotates automatically. I have checked out ebooks from my local library and bought some Kindle books as well, and all of them loaded to my Kindle with no issues. I'm using Amazon's payment plan to pay for it, which is amazing, so I didn't have to pay for it all at once. I have absolutely no regrets about buying this device!"
thisismaggie,5,"October 12, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I have nothing bad to say about this product - there are a fair number of negative reviews but I have not experienced anything negative. My previous Kindle was from 2014 (I believe) so it had no backlighting, was much thicker, the touchscreen was more faulty and less fast, there were no buttons, etc. This new one is fast, the touchscreen works great, and I loooooove the ability to customize the backlighting (brightness and warmth). I also really like that the screen flips so you can pass it to your right/left hand. A few other features I like are the ability to turn off the touchscreen (so you don't have to worry about it when you're in the groove of reading), and the ability to see the book cover vs. list of books in your library. I am 150% satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend to anyone."
Zike,3,"May 25, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"the first thing you realize is it's half or a third shorter than the old Kindle I had. Then there's the fact it's in black and white - which shouldn't mean much except on my Iphone the kindle app does show colors. But really, then you get right down to it, it's a luxury item when people are starving and worse in these times so these are far from anything other than embarrassing little comments and really, I should be thankful and I am that on this Memorial Day 2020 here in time and place where the future is unwritten and uncertain, I have a relatively modern convenience in my hand - that can hold more books that I can read and provide me the convenience to read 24/7.  Yes, if you're reading this and I work with you, even on work books I've purchased and in fact, sadly or valiantly, I have quite a few of those! Stay safe. Heed science. Appreciate technology."
Rmill,2,"December 5, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I bought the new kindle oasis to take the place of my perfectly fine paper white.

I get about 3 days of reading in before I have to recharge it. That is with WiFi turned off, brightness set at 7 and reading for roughly 3 hours a night. After spending $297.00 after tax, I am very very disappointed in this device. I thought about contacting Amazon for a replacement, but they replace your brand new devices with refurbished ones. I don’t think that’s cool since it’s less than a month old. Until the battery drain issue is resolved, I would not recommend purchasing this.I do love the design and the build. It’s unfortunate it doesn’t come remotely close to what the specs says it will do before charging...."
cristin,2,"January 3, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I use this mainly for reading library books. Its hard to navigate to the books I've downloaded. Pretty sure this is done by design so you will pay Amazon for book downloads. I tried the free trial of Kindle Unlimited and most of the books I wanted to read still had to be paid for. It doesn't appear to download Epub books either.I ordered this because I thought it was supposed to have blue light filtering, I guess it does but I really can't tell the difference. I also thought this would have a deeper black and white contrast for reading at night but when I switch to the black screen its really more of a gray screen and still very bright.Even at the largest text size I still need reading glasses at night with this (I use the the 1.5x drugstore reading glasses) though I can read with no problem during the day.At the end of the day a regular tablet would have been more versatile and I wouldn't have to check out books from my phone to push them to the Kindle."
Cindy Duncan,5,"December 11, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I was hesitant to upgrade from my 3rd generation kindle keyboard because of the lack of a keyboard but I LOVE this kindle. The touchscreen makes the keyboard unnecessary and the backlight feature is wonderful. I did want the side buttons which is why I chose this version. You can flip it over to use the buttons on either side depending on how you are holding it.  Or you can tap the screen to advance the page. But the combination of all those features for me make it the perfect upgrade and I don't regret it at all. Battery life seems fine to me, usually about two weeks with me reading a little every day. Seems to charge pretty quickly as well. Highly recommend especially for those with the older kindle."
Tabitha Smith,5,"April 5, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"This is my very first e-reader. I wasn't sure which one I would go with but after doing my own research I decided on the Kindle Oasis for the bigger screen, the extra LEDS, and the page turning buttons. I love reading but its getting harder for me to do because of my eyes not being as good as they used to be. I get migraines frequently and when I try to read conventional books, the extra eye strain makes those migraines worse and/or come about more often. It's also getting harder to hold books for longer periods of time due to joint pains in my hands so instead of putting my books away for good, I decided to try an E-Reader. I ordered this product and it came about 2 days later, so shipping was fast and reliable. Everything came in perfect working order and it was easy to set up. I am already a Prime member so everything I needed to get started getting my paper book collection in ebook form was just a few clicks away. The customization on the brightness level is great. I can read in low to no light or bright light with no problem. Font sizes can be changed for me to see the words easier and bookmarking where I've left off is a breeze. I am really loving this e-reader and wish I had gotten it much sooner. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone with similar problems as me, or anyone for that matter who loves to read as it is so portable and easy to take all my books wherever I go."
Kindle Customer,3,"November 28, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"Battery life is okay at best and I think the battery meter is unreliable sometimes.  The screen saver is an eyesore.  It grows ugly and tedious after a while.  I opted for no ads because the ads were even worse so the extra twenty dollars was worth it to me.The most frustrating thing though is that sometimes when I tap the screen to advance the page in a book it randomly jumps to a place near the beginning of the book.  Occasionally tapping ""Back"" on the top menu will return my to  the proper location, but not always and then it doesn't remember my place in the book."
LGS625,4,"August 5, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I was looking for a waterproof e-reader to replace my Barnes and Noble Nook that frequently overheats outdoors, thereby rendering it unusable just when I want to ready most at the pool or on the patio.. I also found that I was constantly touching the wrong spots on the Nook screen and closing my books accidentally. The design of the Kindle Oasis is easier to hold without accidentally turning pages or returning to the home screen. I love the option to use the buttons to turn the pages. It makes it easier to manage with just one hand. I also find it much easier to check out books from my local library on the Kindle. So far, the book hasn't overheated outside. Fortunately, I haven't had to test the waterproof capabilities. The warm light is nice for bedtime reading. So far, so good. The only criticism I have is that it does not come with a charger you can plug into the wall. I was able to find one that works, but for the price, this item should include its own charger."
Kep,5,"August 10, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,"I loved my old Kindle, but it was slow and kinda unconfirmed to hold for long periods of time. Not the case with the new 2019 Oasis. This thing is super responsive to touch and rotation. I actually use the hardware buttons more than I expected for turning pages, just because they're right where my thumb is resting naturally. The little bump in the back feels more like holding a folded book. I take this to the gym every day and read for a couple hours while I'm jogging on the treadmill - helps keep me going, as I always want to finish just one more chapter, which results in extra exercise and better commitment to my fitness goals."
Chris R. Johnson,4,"April 20, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I was an early adopter of the Kindle and have owned several.  Once the iPad Pros came out, I switched to reading on the iPad with the Kindle app.  Since I always read/work using Dark Mode on my Macs and iPads, when I saw that the Kindle Oasis had a warm light I decided to give it a try.  I like the warm light on the Oasis, it definitely helps reduce eye strain.  The main negatives are the sluggish speed due to an under powered processor and the dark mode is too dark and does not provide enough contrast.  Hopefully, Amazon will address both of these issues in future versions.  I would also very much like to see Kindle be able to connect to Dropbox directly (which is a feature in the new Kobos)."
Ginny L.,5,"April 27, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I chose the Oasis over the Paperwhite because it is large enough to make me feel like I'm reading a book and I have room to make the print as comfortably large as I want without adding numerous page turns. Speaking of page turns, the turn button is so convenient and ensures that I don't leap ahead or back unintentionally. Being able to set the brightness of the screen, the warmth of the background, the size of the type, and being able to flip it open (I got the leather cover too) in the middle of the night and read without turning on a light is so convenient.The ability to access word definitions, Wikipedia, and more right from my reading screen are wonderful and it's light weight means I can take it with me easily and I always have a book with me!Some people have complained about the battery life. My Oasis has days' long battery storage and recharges quickly.I'm very pleased with my choice and would do it again."
Cynthia Miller,5,"January 28, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"This is the fourth Kindle I've owned.  My first was a DX purchased in 2009; the second was a Touch purchased in 2011, my third was a gift of a Voyage in 2015 and finally my Oasis.  I've been interesting in book readers since I read about the possibility of their production in an editorial in a science fiction magazine in the 80s.  The selling point was the ability to change the size of the text for the elderly and the visual impaired.  Amazon has done a fabulous job with this as well as the ease of reading on their Kindles.  I got the Touch so my dad could use the DX.  I liked the Touch because it was lighter than the DX however it wasn't backlit which I thought was a great improvement when I saw a backlit Nook.  The DX got to heavy for my dad so I gave him my Touch and my husband gave me the Voyage which I was happy with the back lighting however I didn't care for how it adjusted the lighting so I turned that feature off.  I got my husband an Oasis in 2017 when the DX got too heavy for him and he loved it so much that he bought one for his brother-in-law to use when he was recovering from hip surgery.  The buttons on my Voyage started to act flaky in mid 2019 so a put an Oasis on my wishlist.  My only hesitation is it looked like it was designed for right handed people.  I thought it was so cool when I got mine and the screen flips so you can hold it and use the buttons left handed.  I decided to try the new adaptable lighting and so far it is a major improvement to what was on my Voyage."
Contrisger,5,"January 28, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"I really like the size of the Oasis, it's light and easy to handle.  The flexibility of use is phenomenal!  You can flip it to use the buttons on the left or right, or you can touch the screen on the left or right, or you can swipe.  Setting the font to a size you're comfortable with is simple.  I've had no problems reading in the bright light of day or the darkness of evening.  The battery goes and goes and goes.  It came with three months of Kindle Unlimited and I will definitely be continuing the subscription when that runs out. It is terrific to be able to read the same book on my Kindle or my phone or my tablet and have the app keep track of where I'm at, even if I'm listening to the audio book in my car and wanting to switch back to reading at home.  The waterproof feature is neat but I haven't had occasion to try that out yet, maybe next summer at the beach.  It was a little pricey but so far it seems to be worth it."
Marcos Yturri,1,"April 1, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"First things first: don’t buy this under Amazon’s trade-in program. Although Amazon states that you’ll get 20% off on a new kindle, that’s a lie. I was not given 20% off this brick, I was given 20% off an Echo. If I had known that the ad for 20% wasn’t going to be toward a new kindle, I would have kept my old Paperwhite.  Despite going back and forth with Amazon and pointing out that the website clearly states it’s off the kindle...well, their response was basically “sorry, nope, we lie.”Secondly, I love ebooks. I’ve purchased hundreds. As much as I’d love to keep doing that, this thing won’t connect to the WiFi in my home. No other device has a problem connecting. Amazon’s chatbot is as helpful as Roy from The IT Crowd in resolving the issue.Anyway, Kobo’s Libra does everything this can do for $100 less. I’ll be returning this brick and buying one of those."
Alisha T,4,"June 21, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,The only issue I have is you can't immersion read... You can't listen to audiobooks while also reading. I really miss that feature since I got use to it on the kindle app on mobile.  I also feel for the price your pay for the Oasis it should definitely be a feature that's why 4 stars instead of 5. I am hoping at some point kindle will upgrade this feature  I have had the kindle fire but the kindle Oasis is definitely a better option for the avid reader . I enjoy that it doesn't let you do much else but read. That way I won't get distracted by web browser and game play or apps. It's like carrying a million books in one hand. It really holds alot. I get constantly ask what the device is and people are always impressed with it . I like sleek and light weight feel.
Erin Nicole Hollingsworth,5,"October 22, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"Absolutely love the warm light with this kindle! My eyes are dry and I have trouble seeing even with glasses. I keep my phone and laptop on dark or warm mode, and when I saw this kindle had warm mode I knew I had to have it! The warm mode is very nice and soothing to my eyes. I don’t even feel like I’m reading on a screen. My old kindle paperwhite I’ve had for almost 8 years and I just decided it was time for a new one. I also love that I can use the Libby app on my phone, check out ebooks from my local library, and send them directly to my kindle. I also enjoy the buttons and that the screen flips depending on how I want to hold it. The battery life has been amazing and so far I’ve already read several books on a single charge. I haven’t tested the water resistance yet and hopefully I won’t have to. Overall very pleased with my purchase and have no complaints as of right now."
Will,5,"January 5, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,I debated about getting a kindle for quite a while. I thought I would miss the feel of a regular book. Now that I have a Kindle Oasis I absolutely love it. It has so many great features. Not only does it have a built in dictionary but it has a feature called X-ray that lets you look up characters in the book and get information about them. There are also so many other nice features. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that most of the books I want to read are available in ebook format from my local library through an app called Overdrive. It’s so convenient no more trips to the library to get and return books. I tried a free three month subscription to Kindle unlimited but I’m not going to continue it. As I said I can get most of the book I want to read through my library plus if I do want to purchase an ebook they are very inexpensive.I chose an Oasis after doing a lot of research and I’m very glad I did. It’s was worth the increase in price over the paper white.
Kindle Customer,1,"March 25, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"The Kindle Oasis, which I received a few days ago is such a disappointment. My Kindle Fire stopped connecting to the internet and since I need that to order new books, I decided to ""upgrade"". NOT. The Oasis is a step down, not particularly user friendly, and a waste of money. Why make changes that don't need to be done. Silk is OK, scrolling with my fire was much better than tuning pages, why put buttons on the Oasis when a touch on the screen will do the job. I read a lot and often have 2 books going.I read the user manual and have a book on Oasis, but I find I get on an old Paperwhite to do much of my reading and reading several things on the internet. Live and learn. My first disappointment with Amazon."
Linda Napoli,4,"September 28, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"First of all, I really love this Kindle.  The Oasis is everything is claims to be with one exception.  The screen brightness can be turned down (I like it at 0 since I do not like to read with a back lit display) and the temperature (color) is a wonderful feature.  It makes it feel more like a real book.The ONE area where I am disappointed is the the battery life.  All things considered, the battery life is good.  I can probably get through two novels on one charge, but from what I had read, I expected a week of battery life, not two days.  I read one novel on a full battery charge which took me about 8 hours.  I turned off the screen when I stopped (I have two kids, so I get interrupted a lot) and had the brightness almost all the way down most of the time.  When I was done with the book, I had 51% battery life left.  Like I said, this is not bad, but not quite what I had expected.Overall, I am really enjoying it.  I'm happy I got it and happy I paid extra for the larger memory option and making it ad-free."
ila b,1,"January 25, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"original NEW Oasis had issues when i had it just for one month - with freezing when attempting to open a downloaded book, 2nd replacement was a refurbished edition - returned that, then replacement of a NEW Oasis arrived - this one made it 4 days before problems -  adjustable light constantly changed, (yes, you can set the light you want it to be at - but this model changed the light all the time),  then the whole screen went a black/grey color, and decided that Oasis is not for me.  did like the size, weight and style of the Oasis - but none of that makes up for the lack of being able to use it."
Bret,1,"July 17, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,I received the 10th gen Kindle Oasis today. And just like my 9th gen Kindle Oasis I can't update the software. The option to check for an update is grayed out. Meaning you can no longer request it you just have to wait till they do it. I don't know when 5.13.1 was released but I use my 9th gen every single day and check every single day for the update which it won't allow me to do and both the old device that is 3 years old shows 5.12.3 with no options upgrade either device. I've contacted customer support who was of no help basically telling me that I can manually update the device I just received today or return it within 30 days. Why would anyone this day and age with over the air updates for all devices including refrigerators want to pay $260 plus dollars for something that had outdated software on it with no option but to manually sit down at a computer and do it yourself. I recently purchased a boox poke 2 and I'm waiting on the shipment. I'm very excited because so far it seems superior in many ways and will allow me to read my Kindle library which at this point I would gladly abandon.
VERONICA,3,"February 4, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,"Do the people who create new Kindle versions actually read books on them?1. Biggest problem:  I am 73 and a voracious reader.  My fingers and hands also have some arthritis.  It is hard to hold this new Kindle Oasis because there are no places to hold it without unwittingly touching the screen and thus turning the page.  The Oasis does have one Side with the page turning buttons which makes easier to hold on the right side.  Thus I don't understand why a side can't be bigger on the left.  THE COVERS AVAILABLE DO NOT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.2. Second problem:Sorting Feature-  I have over a thousand books on the device or in the cloud.  I like Collections, but they are not easy to retrieve.  I have to page through 70 pages to get to Woods, Stuart.  Especially when trying to add books to a collection3. Third problem: Receiving books I have ordered months earlier.  Today, I knew I should have JD Robb's newest IN Death.  However it was not on my home screen like before, when books would be delivered seamlessly.  When I went to Recent -Unread, it still wasn't there.  I had to go to the store.  Look it up.  It told me I had purchased it today, but I had to download it from the store page.I SICERELY HOPE SOMEONE WITH AUTHORITY READS THIS AND DOES SOMETHING TO MAKE THE KINDLE BETTER."

   I've been a long term kindle user, but never a kindle owner. I personally LOVE books, especially physical ones I can feel, flip, store. But I enjoy nighttime reading, and the light from an electronic is less intrusive (and easier when traveling!!) So when the opportunity came to possess my very own kindle, I was ecstatic.  It is everything I always wanted! It is lightweight, durable, easy to use, and has a stupidly long battery life!I have seen multiple comments about the fact this ""updated"" kindle uses an outdated charging source, but I don't personally see the fuss. It charges well overnight, and honestly unless you are reading every day, 9+ hours a day you won't really notice anything.I personally LOVE the page turning button, and the fact you can switch which button does what. AND that no matter which way you flip your kindle, the top button still functions as a top button. (Read one of the other reviews, a delightful woman goes into this feature more with a video!)If you are looking to buy a kindle, I highly recommend this one. And I agree witb others, if you're already splurging,  go in for the 32 not the 8. You'll thank us later."
Douglas Meyer,5,"August 28, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,I really love this Kindle device in that it's light weight with a long lasting battery as long as you don't have the backlit screen cranked all the way up. On a setting of 25% ~ 33% the battery should last several weeks easy. I really like the design but a case is an absolute must because it's far better and more comfortable to hold and it won't let you scratch you device. I purchased my with 32 gigs of storage and personally anything less than 32 gigs is a shame because once you start reading on this beautiful device you'll be wanting to purchase a bunch more books.
John J. Floro,5,"January 18, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,"I struggled to decide if I wanted to cough up the extra money for this e-reader, but I am so glad I did!  A few of the things I like about it are the 7"" screen, the even and adjustable lighting, and the push button or screen tap features. However, the best feature, over my previous Paperwhite, is the fast speed of the processor.  I would never think the processor speed would make the reading experience much different, but it sure does. The battery life is as described.  I have only had it a week and have been through about 2.5 books (1 of which was an Audible book) and have only recharged it once when it went down to 30%. I love this thing!"
